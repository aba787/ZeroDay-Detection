🧩 Research Aim (الهدف الرئيسي):

The main aim of this project is to design and evaluate a machine learning–based system capable of detecting zero-day attacks by learning normal and abnormal network traffic patterns. The goal is to enhance early threat detection beyond traditional signature-based intrusion detection systems.

❓ Research Questions:

How can machine learning models effectively detect unknown or zero-day attacks in network traffic?

Which ML algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forest, Random Forest, Autoencoder) achieve the best performance in identifying anomalous network behavior?

How does the model’s performance compare when applied to multiple datasets?

💡 Research Problem (المشكلة):

Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) rely on signature-based techniques, which fail to detect unknown or zero-day attacks because they depend on previously known attack patterns. This creates a critical security gap where organizations remain vulnerable to new and unseen threats.

⚠️ Research Gap:

Most existing research focuses on detecting known attacks using supervised learning or rule-based systems. However, there’s still limited focus on detecting unseen zero-day attacks using unsupervised or semi-supervised ML techniques that can generalize to new threats without labeled data.

🧠 Purpose of the Project:

To build a system that:

Learns from network traffic patterns (normal vs. abnormal).

Detects new and unknown attacks in real-time or near real-time.

Evaluates and compares the performance of different ML techniques for anomaly detection.

Provides an interpretable output (dashboard or alert system) for users.

📊 Dataset Plan:
Dataset Type:

Network flow data — typically includes:

Source/Destination IP

Port numbers

Protocol type

Packet count, size, timing

Duration, bytes in/out

Possible Datasets to Use:

UNSW-NB15 — modern dataset simulating real-world attacks (recommended).

CICIDS2017 or CICIDS2018 — detailed, labeled datasets for various network intrusions.

NSL-KDD — older, smaller dataset (good for model testing and comparisons).

You can use 2–3 datasets for comparison (as المشرفة قالت: “كل ما كان أكثر كان أفضل”).

Data Source:

All datasets are publicly available and anonymized (non-identifiable data) → compliant with ethical requirements.

⚙️ Methodology (طريقة العمل):

Data Collection:
Download public network datasets (UNSW-NB15, CICIDS2017).

Data Preprocessing:

Remove duplicates

Normalize numerical features

Encode categorical features (protocols, etc.)

Feature Engineering:
Create statistical and temporal features (e.g., average packet size, flow duration).

Model Selection:
Test multiple ML algorithms:

Isolation Forest (unsupervised anomaly detection)

Autoencoder (neural-based)

Random Forest / SVM (supervised baseline)

Model Evaluation:
Metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

Visualization:
Create a simple dashboard (Matplotlib/Streamlit) showing:

Real-time detection results

Confusion matrix or ROC curve

Reporting:
Document methodology, results, discussion, and conclusion.

🧩 Why Machine Learning (not DL or Hybrid):

Dataset size: Smaller datasets → ML is more efficient and requires less computational power.

Interpretability: ML models are easier to explain and justify in research (important academically).

Baseline Approach: ML gives a strong, explainable baseline — once validated, DL or hybrid can be future work.

Focus: Your project emphasizes detecting patterns, not training on huge image/video datasets.

You can mention: “Deep learning may outperform ML in large-scale or complex data, but for this project’s scope and dataset size, machine learning offers a more interpretable and practical solution.”

🚀 Future Enhancement Ideas (for discussion):

Integrating hybrid approaches (e.g., combining ML + DL).

Implementing real-time intrusion detection.

Testing on live captured traffic.

Deploying on cloud or simulated IoT networks.

🧾 Ethical Considerations:

Only publicly available, anonymized datasets.

No personal, identifiable, or sensitive data.

Results are used purely for research and educational purposes.

🧭 Expected Deliverables:
